# IR Remote Controlled DC Motors

This project was done at Vellore Institute of Technology by Naveen Lalwani, Karan Rawlani, Anmol Saxena and Sulakhana Chakraborty. The team was led by Naveen and the project was done as a course project for EEE401 Electric Drives and Control under Dr. Elangovan D.<BR>
The project aims at controlling DC Motor and servo motor using IR remote. The speed and the direction of the motors are controlled. The speed is controlled using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technique and speed can be set to any speed as percentage of the total speed in the range of multiples of 10. The servo motor can be rotated in steps of 5 and 10 degrees in any direction along with set button for certain angles. The user needs to set the motor for which he is making the change and make the change. <BR>
We had made our own H-Bridge for connecting the motors to the Arduino board to learn more about drive control and the switching of voltage polarity for making the motor run in either direction. 

The working demo of the project using motor driver circuit is available at https://youtu.be/LDMpHZEXQSQ
